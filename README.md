## The Philosophy

"Whose Turn Now" is designed to solve a simple, recurring social problem with a clean, transparent, and forgiving interface. The core principle is that the turn-tracking list should be a **dynamic queue**, not a static rotation. The application is built on an immutable, auditable log, ensuring every action is recorded and verifiable.

## Core Features

*   **‚ö°Ô∏è Instant Anonymous Use:** Start using the app instantly without an account. Your lists are saved to your session, and you can create a permanent account later to save them forever.
*   **üîÑ Dynamic Turn Queue:** The person at the top of the list is always next. When a turn is completed, they move to the bottom. Simple, visual, and intuitive.
*   **‚è≠Ô∏è Skip Your Turn:** If it's your turn, you can choose to skip, moving you to the end of the queue without incrementing your turn count.
*   **üë• Managed Participants:** Keep track of turns for anyone, even if they don't have the app. Perfect for managing kids' chores, pets, or friends who aren't online.
*   **ü§ù "Council of Admins" Management:** All admins have equal power to manage a list, add participants, and promote other admins. There's no single "owner" bottleneck.
*   **‚Ü©Ô∏è Three-Turn Undo Stack:** Accidentally completed a turn? No problem. The app allows you to undo the last three valid turns. Every undo is a transparent, logged action that reverts the state.
*   **üìú Immutable Turn History:** Every action‚Äîcompleting a turn, skipping, resetting counts, or undoing‚Äîis recorded in a permanent, timestamped log for full transparency.
*   **üé® Personalized Lists:** Give your lists personality with a selectable emoji icon.
*   **üîó Invite via Link:** Easily invite friends to join your list with a simple, shareable URL.
