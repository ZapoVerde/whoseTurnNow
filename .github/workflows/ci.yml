    steps:
      # Step 1: Get the code from the repository
      - name: 'Checkout code'
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up pnpm, our package manager
      - name: 'Set up pnpm'
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: 8 # Use a recent version of pnpm

      # Step 3: Set up the correct version of Node.js
      - name: 'Set up Node.js'
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'pnpm' # Cache our dependencies for faster runs

      # Step 4: Install all project dependencies
      - name: 'Install dependencies'
        run: pnpm install

      # Step 5: Run the linter for the "whoseturnnow" package
      # This ensures code style is consistent.
      - name: 'Run linter'
        run: pnpm --filter @aianvil/whoseturnnow lint

      # Step 6: Run the build command for the "whoseturnnow" package
      # This ensures the code is valid and can be compiled.
      - name: 'Run build'
        run: pnpm --filter @aianvil/whoseturnnow build

      # Step 7: Run the test suite for the "whoseturnnow" package.
      # This ensures our business logic is correct.
      - name: 'Run tests'
        run: pnpm --filter @aianvil/whoseturnnow test
